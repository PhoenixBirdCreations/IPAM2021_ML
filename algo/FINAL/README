3 label classification

Crossvalidation for searching the hyperparameters that get best score

RF:  X trees, Y max depth,  Z criteria

KNN: X neighbors,  Y distance,  Z ???

Computed for HasNS and HasREM separately:
      ROC curves (png, exported [fp, tp, thr])
      Histogram (png, exported [bins, counts])
      TP, FP at thr= [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.95]
