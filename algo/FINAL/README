3 label classification

Crossvalidation for searching the hyperparameters that get best score

RF:  95 trees, 15 max depth,  entropy criteria

KNN: 10 neighbors,  manhattan metric,  ball tree algorithm, distance weights 

Computed for HasNS and HasREM separately:
      ROC curves (png, exported [fp, tp, thr])
      Histogram (png, exported [bins, counts])
      TP, FP at thr= [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.95]


RF Has NS:

RF Has REM:
Threshold  0.1 TP: 0.997, FP 0.030
Threshold  0.3 TP: 0.991, FP 0.015
Threshold  0.5 TP: 0.983, FP 0.009
Threshold  0.8 TP: 0.954, FP 0.003
