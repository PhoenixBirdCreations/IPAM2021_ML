\section{Improving Recovered Parameters through Regression}
\label{sec:ML_concept}

\lorena{For a given problem, there are different machine learning algorithms
that one can use to approximate a solution. In our case, we choose to employ
Gaussian Process Regression and Neural Networks due to their interpretability
and accuracy, respectively.}
