\section{Conclusions}
%Information regarding future work and prelimiary results with O3:
%O3 MDC data contains $18,311$ systems which are recovered by the 
%\texttt{PyCBC}, \texttt{GstLAL}, and \texttt{MBTAOnline} pipelines. 
%The number of triggers recovered by these three detection pipelines 
%are $8,742$, $7,221$, and $2,348$, respectively.}

Reiterate why what we did is important and how it improves current knowledge.
