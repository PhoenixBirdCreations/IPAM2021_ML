\section{Probability and Labeling Scheme} \label{probability}

Bayesian probabilities for the \hasns\ and \hasrem\ metrics can be defined using the results of the \ac{KNN} and \ac{RF} algorithms, namely the fraction of \ac{KNN}'s neighbors and
\ac{RF}'s trees that predict a given label. In this section, we define the probabilities and explain how to derive them from a data set of simulated signals.
