\section*{Acknowledgments}

We are very grateful to the authors of Ref.~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs} for fruitful discussions and for sharing their work that helped us to directly compare
our methods to those used in \ac{LVK}'s \ac{O3} observing run. We would also like to thank the many other colleagues of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and
the Virgo Collaboration who have provided invaluable help over the years.

This work is based upon work supported by the LIGO Laboratory which is a major facility fully funded by the National Science Foundation. We are grateful for computational resources provided by
the LIGO Laboratory and supported by the U.S.\ National Science Foundation Grants PHY-0757058 and PHY-0823459.
