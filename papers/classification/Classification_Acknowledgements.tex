\section*{Acknowledgments}


We are very grateful to the authors of Ref.~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs} for fruitful discussions and for sharing their work that helped us to directly compare
our methods to those used in \ac{LVK}'s \ac{O3} observing run. We would also like to thank the many other colleagues of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and
the Virgo Collaboration who have provided invaluable help over the years.
