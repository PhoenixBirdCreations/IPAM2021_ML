\section{Introduction\label{intro}}
%In our introduction we want to start from big picture (LIGO, ML, pipelines)
%and narrow down to what work we are presenting here and why it is important. We
%also describe in which ways it is novel and how it compares to previous works
%like in~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs}. We may also want to cite~\cite{Sachdev:2020lfd}. 

The first detection of a \ac{GW} signal from a pair of coalescing black holes in 2015 and the first observation of a coalescing binary neutron system two years later
have established \ac{MMA} as a powerful tool for the exploration of the cosmos~\cite{LIGOScientific:2016aoc,LIGOScientific:2017vwq}. The third \ac{LVK} catalog of transient \ac{GW} signals \ac{GWTC3}~\cite{LIGOScientific:2021djp}
has shown that \ac{GW} astronomy has entered its mature phase, becoming a true observational branch of astronomy. In the next few years, \ac{MMA} will allow scientists
to explore in depth the origin and structure of black holes~\cite{Schmidt:2020ekt} (and Nitz:2021zwj), neutron stars (for a review in the properties of neutron stars emitting GWs~\cite{Lasky:2015uia}, for binaries~\cite{Baiotti:2016qnr} and as it was shown for GW170817~\cite{LIGOScientific:2018cki}), and gamma-ray bursts~\cite{Ciolfi:2018tal}; test general relativity; probe the fundamental nature of gravity; and
measure the evolution of the universe~\cite{LIGOScientific:2021sio,LIGOScientific:2021psn,LIGOScientific:2021aug}.

Improved \ac{GW} detector sensitivities will bring a wealth of new detections to achieve these science goals~\cite{LIGOScientific:2014pky,VIRGO:2014yos}. The rate
of detections in \ac{LVK}'s \ac{O4} is expected to be more than one per day, further increasing in the \ac{O5}~\cite{KAGRA:2013rdx}. Over the course of
these runs, the \ac{LVK} collaboration will analyze hundreds of \ac{BBH} and dozens of \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} detections, several of which could be \ac{MMA} sources. Among the
challenges that this new phase of \ac{GW} astronomy brings is the necessity to coordinate the activities of \ac{EM} and \ac{GW} observatories on a very short time
scale. 

One of the most interesting areas of study in \ac{GW} astronomy is the physics of gravity-matter interaction in \ac{MMA} sources. Tidally disrupted matter in an
\ac{NSBH} system may form a high-temperature accretion disk around the \ac{BH} and trigger the creation of a prompt \ac{EM} emission in the form of a short \ac{GRB}. If
the system ejecta are unbound, r-process nucleosynthesis may lead to a \ac{KN}~\cite{Lattimer:1974slx, Li:1998bw, Korobkin:2012uy, Barnes:2013wka, Tanaka:2013ana,
Kasen:2014toa}. These phenomena could also arise in \ac{BNS} post-mergers through the expulsion of neutron-rich material even when tidal forces are weak~\cite{LIGOScientific:2017ync, Arcavi:2017xiz, Coulter:2017wya, Kasliwal:2017ngb, Lipunov:2017dwd, DES:2017kbs, Tanvir:2017pws}. The presence of a post-merger matter
remnant, which results in an \ac{EM} signature or a prompt collapse, is a common factor in all of these scenarios. Determining the potential of a \ac{GW} source to
become an \ac{EM} emitter and enabling coincident observations of these systems by \ac{EM} and \ac{GW} observatories in real time are crucial for the success of
\ac{MMA}.

The \ac{LVK} employs different matched-filtering pipelines for low-latency \ac{GW} searches~\cite{Sachdev:2020lfd,Nitz:2018rgo,Adams:2015ulm} \todo{references for pipelines
and add spiir}. These searches are based on discrete template banks of \ac{CBC} waveforms that provide, among other parameters, the component masses and the
dimensionless (anti-)aligned spins of the objects along the orbital angular momentum. These parameters can be used to determine the \emph{\ac{EM} properties} of
\ac{GW} candidates in low latency through empirical fits of \ac{NR} simulations~\cite{Foucart:2012nc,Foucart:2018rjc}. Low-latency preliminary alerts of candidate
\ac{GW} events in the \ac{O3} included two \ac{EM}-property metrics identifying whether the \ac{CBC} system contains a \ac{NS}, \hasns, and a post-merger matter
remnant, \hasrem. Alerts with similar content continue to be issued in \ac{O4} with a latency of the order of one second after the detection of candidate merger events.  Additionally, \ac{LVK}'s \ac{O4} alerts will include a measure of the \hasgap\ property, i.e., the likelihood that one of the source compact objects has a mass in the lower-mass gap region between \ac{NS}s and \ac{BH}s.

Classification of \ac{GW} candidate events in real time poses several challenges as the desire for accuracy contrasts with the desire to issue the information as
quickly as possible. The approach taken in the last two observing runs has been to use a supervised \ac{KNN}~\cite{Pedregosa:2011ork} \ac{ML} algorithm with input from the detection pipelines
and \ac{EOS} models to generate independent \hasns\ and \hasrem\ binary classification \emph{scores}~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs}. The \ac{KNN} model was trained on a broad set
of synthetic \ac{CBC} signals injected in real detector noise from the \ac{O2}. The advantage of this scheme relies in the capability of the method to handle the
statistical uncertainties of the parameters from the search pipelines and the non-stationarity of the detectors' power spectral density. This allowed for a marked
improvement in performance compared to the semi-analytic effective Fisher formalism method which was deployed in \ac{O2}.

In this work, we revisit the problem of real-time production of \hasns\ and \hasrem\ \emph{probability} metrics with the aim of further improving the latency and performance of the current
\ac{LVK} \ac{ML}-based scheme ~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs}. In the current implementation, the validity of the classification outcome for an event is assessed through elements of the algorithm's
confusion matrix and its \ac{ROC} curve. For example, given a positive prediction, the \ac{LVK} defines the ``probability'' that this prediction is correct as the \ac{TPR} for the given data set.
However, there is no quantity in the algorithm's confusion matrix that defines a probability in the strictest sense. A second limitation of current \hasns\ and \hasrem\ classification schemas is
the fact that the \hasns\ and \hasrem\ labels are treated as independent variables. In reality, the probability of a system being \ac{EM} bright is always smaller than the probability of the
system hosting a \ac{NS}. Therefore, the \hasns\ and \hasrem\ labels cannot be treated as disjoint. In the current \ac{LVK} implementation, this physical condition is not mathematically defined in
the algorithm implementation, but its validity is data-based, i.e., it is checked a posteriori through (coarse) parameter sweeps. One of the main purposes of this work is to go beyond the above
scheme and calculate true \emph{conditional Bayesian probabilities} for \hasns\ and \hasrem. 

To address these shortcomings, in this paper we perform a thorough study of a set of alternative \ac{ML} algorithms and different classification schemes. We first design a scheme for conditional
\hasns\ and \hasrem\ metrics that incorporates the physical requirement that a system with a post-merger matter remnant must necessarily contain a \ac{NS}. Then we define and calculate
\emph{Bayesian probabilities} for \hasns\ and \hasrem. The marginalization over different \ac{EOS} minimizes possible systematics arising from the use of a single EOS. Finally,  we compare the
different algorithm performance on synthetic  \ac{O3} signals and confident \ac{GW} detections from the latest \ac{GWTC3} catalog.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect.~\ref{algos}, we introduce the classification algorithms. In Sect.~\ref{dataset} we describe the data set and the classification schema. Section
\ref{results} is dedicated to the results of each method and their comparison. Conclusions and future developments are presented in Sect.~\ref{conclusions}.
