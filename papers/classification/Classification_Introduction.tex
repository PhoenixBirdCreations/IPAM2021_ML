\section{Introduction}
In our introduction we want to start from big picture (LIGO, ML, pipelines)
and narrow down to what work we are presenting here and why it is important. We
also describe in which ways it is novel and how it compares to previous works
like in~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs}. We may also want to cite~\cite{Sachdev:2020lfd}. 


The breakthrough observation of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger simultaneously in gravitational and electromagnetic (E/M) waves \cite{LIGOScientific:2017ync} marked a new era of multi-messenger astronomy including for first time gravitational waves (GWs). The event GW170817 gave answers to open questions, such as the origin and production of Gamma-ray bursts (*cite), the production of heavy elements during a merger of BNS (*cite), rule out Equations of States (*cite) and alternative theories of gravity (*cite), +?. Among the challenges that it brings is the early alert of the E/M telescopes. Some of the expected sources to produce an E/M counterpart are the coalescences of a neutron star with another neutron star (NSNS) or with a black hole (NSBH). In the case of NSNS: GRBs, neutron star. For NSBH: accretion disk --> short GRBs.

Numerical relativity simulations can provide accurate information about the coalesence of the binary system and its aftermath/remnant. However, these simulations are computationally expensive and require a lot of time, making them inapropriate to alert follow-up E/M searches. It is important to alert the EM ground and space telescopes quickly and accurately. (For example in the event of 2017 the EM telescopes were iinformed after ... *ref?)

In the previous observing runs in LIGO and Virgo there were used different matched-filtering pipelines in low latency in order to detect GWs from CBC, such as GstLAL-based inspiral pipeline (GstLAL) ~\cite{Sachdev:2020lfd}, PyCBCLive(Nitz et al. 2018), MBTAOnline(Adams et al. 2016), SPIIR(Chu 2017).+ During the second observing run O2 it was the first time that real-time data was made available to E/M observatories to support follow-up observations. Classification of the binary systems was performed according to the following probabilities. Specifically, the probability that at least one of the objects in the binary is a NS, p(HasNS) and the probability that there was a matter remnant p(HasRemnant). For instance, in a BNS merger both probabilities will be equal to one, while in a BBH merger, both probabilities will be zero. In ~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs} the authors approach the problem as binary classification and develop a new method based on supervised learning.




- What we suggest, Random Forest classification (what is it, what are the advantages)

In this work, we revisit and extend the problem of classification in low-latency. First, we propose the use of a combined probability of whether there is a NS in the event and whether there is a remnant. By doing so, we exclude the unphysical situation of having a larger probability of having a remnant than having a NS (like in *ref??). In addition, we perform a thorough study of different algorithms, perform several tests and account for different EoSs. We povide a direct comparison between the methods we used, as well as the ones already implemented e.g. in Deep *ref. 

Different methods of classification were considered, such as ... and were tested for the same data. Here, we present the ones that performed best, the Random Forest (RF) and KNeighborClassifier (KNN). The last one is also used in ~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs} and thus we provide a direct comparison. 

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 there is a detailed description of the data used, as well as the labeling introduced. In Section 3, the classification methods, namely Random Forest and KNN are presented.
