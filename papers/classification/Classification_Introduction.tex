\section{Introduction}
In our introduction we want to start from big picture (LIGO, ML, pipelines)
and narrow down to what work we are presenting here and why it is important. We
also describe in which ways it is novel and how it compares to previous works
like in~\cite{Chatterjee:2019avs}. We may also want to cite~\cite{Sachdev:2020lfd}.
