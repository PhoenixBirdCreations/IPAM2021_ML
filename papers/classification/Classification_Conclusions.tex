\section{Conclusions\label{conclusions}}

TO DO LIST:
\\
- Brief summary of the problem we are facing: we need rapid identification of the components of the binary merger, we apply ML to do so. \\
- Say what we did: tested and compared the algorithms on O2, with the scores. Then we come with the Bayesian probs and we make some fits to quickly get the probabilities when there is a real time event. \\
- Discuss the results (MOST IMPORTANT THING): tested in O2, the algorithms perform better for \hasrem\, and RF does it better than KNN. When applied on O3 (this applies for both the scores and the Bayesian probs), the algorithms are better on \hasns\ (and RF still outperforms), but they get worse at \hasrem\, and even KNN is slowly better in this case. It seems that Sushant's assumption is right, and RF finds it more difficult to classify different pipelines and new events (O3 instead of O2) -> it is less adaptable. \\
- Possible future applications?
