\section{Classification Algorithms\label{algos}}

In our analysis we consider two alternative algorithms for unsupervised classification: \ac{KNN} and \ac{RF}. These methods were chosen because of their versatility, ease of implementation in low-latency and comparison with the algorithms currently being used by the \ac{LVK} (\ac{KNN} for \hasns\ and \hasrem\, \ac{RF} for \hasgap).
In this section we briefly describe the relevant features of the algorithms and their implementation.
