\section{Classification Algorithms\label{algos}}

In the our analysis we consider three different methods for unsupervised classification: \ac{KNN}, \ac{RF}, and \ac{GP}. These methods were chosen because of\dots \todo{Why? Because they're fast? Versatile? Because they're what Sydney loves...? Explain}

In this section we briefly describe the relevant features of the algorithms and their implementation.
