  The detection of gravitational wave signals generated by compact binary coalescences that involve neutron stars can led to multi-messenger observations of such events, due to the electromagnetic counterpart that is produced after merger. A rapid identification of the binary elements is necessary to perform proper follow-up operations with electromagnetic telescopes. This identification is done by looking at the properties of the binary system, such as the masses and spins inferred by low latency pipelines. However, the resulting predictions are dominated by systematic errors that might lead to a wrong identification of the system. In this work, we compare two supervised machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest, that success in reducing such errors. We also present a new way to compute the probabilities of having a neutron star in the system and of producing an electromagnetic counterpart with a Bayesian approach.
