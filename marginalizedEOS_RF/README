These are the results from training 23 forests, one for every EoS.

I uploaded the histogram and ROC curves from every EoS, for p(HasNS) and p(HasREM).
The ROC curve for p(HasNS) is always very similar, which is consistent as label HasNS={0,1} does not change much. (I do not know if for the labelling 
they consider the maximum mass of the EoS or they are still using the 3Ms cut. In that case, the label never changes).

The ROC curve for p(HasREM) gives very good results, even better than with the 2H EoS.

All models are a forest of 500 trees, using the entropy criteria and sqrt max_features at the nodes. The score remains consistent in all EoS, around 0.96 (as in 2H).
